In the article, pinÂ¯-TSVM: A Robust Transductive Support Vector Machine and its Application to the Detection of COVID-19 Infected Patients, we have used images of normal chest X-rays, chest X-ray images of patients having bacterial infection and the chest X-ray images of COVID-19 infected patients. 
In Covid Data, three files are given based on chest X-ray images of normal human being (NORMAL), chest X-ray images of covid infected patients (COVID) and with bacterial infection (BACTERIAL INFECTION).
There are 2932 normal chest X-ray images, 5519 bacterial infected images and 932 chest X-ray images of COVID patients. 

1.	Normal chest X-ray images are collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
https://www.kaggle.com/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images
), uploaded by Paul Mooney and Tolga Dincer respectively.

2.	Bacterial Chest X-ray images are also collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

3.	Chest X-ray images of Covid infected patients are collected from the Github link (https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)


Please note that Github has truncated the dataset to 1000 images for Normal and Bacterial infected chest X-ray images. The interested reader can obtain the full dataset used in our work from the given source URLs.
